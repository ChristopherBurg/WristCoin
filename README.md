WristCoin
=========

A Bitcoin price checker for the Pebble wristwatch.

This application uses JavaScript loaded onto the Pebble smartphone app to fetch the current Bitcoin prices from various exchanges. Once the prices have been fetched they are forwarded to the Pebble wristwatch to be displayed.

The main screen will display the average Bitcoin price for each exchange. To get a detailed breakdown of an exchange's pricing (the high, low, last, etc. prices) highlight the exchange and click the select button. Holding down the select button for one second will fetch the latest price data.

Currently the application supports Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and BTC-e. Support for additional exchanges will appear in future releases.
